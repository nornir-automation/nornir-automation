 nornir is a first-class automation framework, so if you are reading this page, you&amp;rsquo;re probably here to learn more. One of the aspects of which sets nornir apart is filtering.
A new how-to guide has been published to the official documentation, walking through a series of use-cases and examples on how to leverage the power and flexibility of nornir filtering.</description>

      <description>I am happy to announce that nornir3 is in beta for you to test. The truth is that it&amp;rsquo;s been out already for a while but at this point I am confident it&amp;rsquo;s stable enough to open it to the wider public for testing.
To install nornir beta you will need to execute the following command:
$ pip install --pre &amp;#34;nornir&amp;gt;=3.0.0b0&amp;#34; Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the --pre option as otherwise pip won&amp;rsquo;t let you install it as it&amp;rsquo;s considered a pre-release.</description>

      <description>The other night there was a discussion about python multi-threading on the nornir channel on slack so I decided to do some benchmarks and explain a couple of things. I am by no means an expert on the topic, I mostly know enough to be scared about the topic and to test assumptions to avoid surprises. I am also going to try to simplify things a bit so apologies in advanced if something is slightly inaccurate.</description>
