      <description>The other night there was a discussion about python multi-threading on the nornir channel on slack so I decided to do some benchmarks and explain a couple of things. I am by no means an expert on the topic, I mostly know enough to be scared about the topic and to test assumptions to avoid surprises. I am also going to try to simplify things a bit so apologies in advanced if something is slightly inaccurate.</description>
